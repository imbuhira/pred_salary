Overview:


Two Barrels is hiring a Ruby on Rails Software Engineers for $110,000/year plus a $10,000 hiring bonus. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.

This particular job is for Ruby experience, but we understand that ROR or a flavor of Ruby isn’t super common locally. If you have solid software engineering experience in a different language, we have a solid path to this mid level software engineer role by coming on board as a JR ROR Software Engineer and working together to monitor how quickly you get up to speed on Ruby with the intent of moving you to this Mid Level Ruby on Rails Software Engineer role when you become proficient in ROR.

About the Job:

At Two Barrels you will work with a close-knit group of engineers who come from a diverse mix of backgrounds and experiences. We build out new exciting Rails projects, maintain and refactor older Rack based ones built in POR. We are constantly evolving, growing and willing to try new technologies and techniques, as long as we meet the businesses needs.

We want someone who is eager to learn and help others but can also take on a project independently and be just fine. Our team supports each other and understands not everyone is the same – some of us are great at CI/CD development, some of us are wizards at SQL, and others just love Plain Old Ruby – meaning although we expect you to work the full-stack we also understand if you prefer to work in one area more than the other.

How to Apply:

Please apply through the link below. It’s a coding job, so showing us some code would be helpful. Preferably a flavor of Ruby or Javascript, but anything for now will do. We will do an initial phone interview, a video call with a small group of our team, and then if everyone is still liking things, typically we’d have you come in and meet everyone, but with Covid we’re doing group video calls right now while we’re all working remote.

Wage:

$110,000/year
*$10,000 hiring bonus**
Responsibilities:
Be a good human
Treat your co-workers with respect
Have a Growth Mindset, not a Fixed Mindset

Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor's Degree in related field or related work experience
3+ years professional experience with full stack application development
Intimately familiar with Rails and Ruby
Experience with front-end web development, HTML, CSS, Javascript
You find satisfaction in a job well done and want to solve hard problems
You have 10 fingers or can type the equivalent speed of a 10 fingered person
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with designing, building, and maintaining efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code
Strong grasp of security principles and how they apply to e-commerce applications
Experience in planning and delivering software
Able to work in an agile environment with a focus on continuous integration
Comfortable with using Docker
Comfortable working with Vue
General understanding of AWS and the services within: ECS, EC2, S3, and RDS
You bring some weird or quirky new aspect of living and humanity to our workforce

Why you might like this job:


You’ve been building large rails apps for other companies. The ones with carrots dangling in front of you, hipster benefits, slippery ladders, and always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software. You like the idea of working for a locally owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like it that your work matters today and will affect millions of business customers of ours.

You like the idea that you could find a place like this in Spokane, where we have 4 seasons, you can buy a great house for a great price and if you have to commute longer than 20 minutes here, people would probably move or not work there. You like it that there’s 5 ski hills within 2 hours. Endless outdoor activities, and people who are here don’t want you bragging about it to cool actual tech cities. You don’t like bugs or humidity or a million people living in your city.

You love to code, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was ok or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because ok or good isn’t fulfilling to you.

But… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3 depending on if you have religion in your life. Our goal is to use the incredible business we’ve been blessed to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life and then we think we’ll have more fun working together during the day, if we know there’s a clear cut off and can create a work environment where we can not only go home, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. There’s no hipster saving or changing the world bs mission statement here. We try to make it a non-hostile job that pays well and doesn’t stress you out so you can call it a day and go have fun personally.

Benefits:

The Foreign Weapon Systems branch goals include the characterization, analysis, testing, and ultimate defeat of all types of threat weapons systems including foreign missiles and radars. This group concentrates primarily on electrical, sensor, optical, and firmware aspects of the systems, but will engage any part of the system that advances our goals. This is hands-on work involving actual threat weapon hardware. Our team develops equipment to control and test these threats in a Hardware-in-the-Loop environment. We also specialize in the development of countermeasure concepts and equipment.

The DSP Software Engineer will analyze the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) firmware and FPGA DSP blocks from foreign weapons to understand the algorithms utilized for tracking, guidance, and counter-countermeasures. The goal of this analysis will be to describe the threat capabilities and vulnerabilities against the U.S. systems that oppose it. Test benches will be developed to verify analysis and further characterize the signal processing chain. Weapon system instrumentation and testing will be supported for data collection purposes. Once analysis is complete, efforts will continue towards developing countermeasures for the threat system in order to ensure its defeat in combat.

We take security extremely seriously and do not drag our metaphorical feet on it. Yes, sometimes taking proper security measures can seem onerous or paranoid. But we've got our priorities straight.
