As we adapt to recent changes in the way our merchants are having to conduct business, we are looking for talented and experienced Engineers who can help us build out the initiatives and features needed to ensure we continue to support our merchants in these challenging times.

About The Role

You will be adding new features to both the web services that support our iPad app, and to our cloud-based reporting and store management application. You will work closely with our Belfast and New York engineers on everything from the databases to the browser. With billions of sales events being handled by our infrastructure, you should be keen to develop scalable software.

Our Stack

At Shopkeep we use a wide variety of technologies. While we have core technologies that we work with, we're always trying to pick the best tool for the job, and are always looking at what's on the horizon.

Our stack currently includes:
React, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Python, React Native, Go
Jenkins, Circle CI, Kubernetes, Docker and AWS
We use Git for source control, write tests and run continuous integration, and review each other's code through pull requests.
Ideally, you will have 3+ years experience in at least one of these technologies or similar patterns; notably, Javascript coupled with React is a core technology for us. But we are more interested in your broader experience of software development, across these languages, rather than of specific tools or libraries.

You should be comfortable getting up-to-speed quickly in new tools and platforms.

How we work

We expect our Software Engineers to be passionate about working in teams, building features to improve the experience of our existing customers, in a collaborative way.

You'll be working in a cross functional, autonomous team, where you will regularly collaborate with our DevOps and Security teams when required.

We practice Scrum and work lean.

Work is not siloed, you're able to commit across the stack, and you have a view of all the features the teams are working on.

We use data to drive continuous improvement in our development process and we review this data in our fortnightly retrospectives.

If you have development experience on a product focused team, real passion for new technologies, open source, small businesses, and a desire to grow and learn, then we might be the right team for you.

Responsibilities
Write clean, readable code - it's not easy but it's important.
Collaborate with our Product and Project Management teams to design & deliver new product features that improve our merchants' businesses.
Work with your team and our Test Engineers to ensure excellent test coverage, as well as, investigate any fix any defects.
Participate in our peer code review process
Mentor and be Mentored. As part of yours and others professional development, mentoring is a part of our culture, to ensure we are setting people up for success within Shopkeep.

Overview:


Two Barrels is hiring a Ruby on Rails Software Engineers for $110,000/year plus a $10,000 hiring bonus. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.

This particular job is for Ruby experience, but we understand that ROR or a flavor of Ruby isn’t super common locally. If you have solid software engineering experience in a different language, we have a solid path to this mid level software engineer role by coming on board as a JR ROR Software Engineer and working together to monitor how quickly you get up to speed on Ruby with the intent of moving you to this Mid Level Ruby on Rails Software Engineer role when you become proficient in ROR.

About the Job:

At Two Barrels you will work with a close-knit group of engineers who come from a diverse mix of backgrounds and experiences. We build out new exciting Rails projects, maintain and refactor older Rack based ones built in POR. We are constantly evolving, growing and willing to try new technologies and techniques, as long as we meet the businesses needs.

We want someone who is eager to learn and help others but can also take on a project independently and be just fine. Our team supports each other and understands not everyone is the same – some of us are great at CI/CD development, some of us are wizards at SQL, and others just love Plain Old Ruby – meaning although we expect you to work the full-stack we also understand if you prefer to work in one area more than the other.

How to Apply:

Please apply through the link below. It’s a coding job, so showing us some code would be helpful. Preferably a flavor of Ruby or Javascript, but anything for now will do. We will do an initial phone interview, a video call with a small group of our team, and then if everyone is still liking things, typically we’d have you come in and meet everyone, but with Covid we’re doing group video calls right now while we’re all working remote.

Wage:

Bachelor's Degree in related field or related work experience
3+ years professional experience with full stack application development
Intimately familiar with Rails and Ruby
Experience with front-end web development, HTML, CSS, Javascript

Why you might like this job:


You’ve been building large rails apps for other companies. The ones with carrots dangling in front of you, hipster benefits, slippery ladders, and always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software. You like the idea of working for a locally owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like it that your work matters today and will affect millions of business customers of ours.

You like the idea that you could find a place like this in Spokane, where we have 4 seasons, you can buy a great house for a great price and if you have to commute longer than 20 minutes here, people would probably move or not work there. You like it that there’s 5 ski hills within 2 hours. Endless outdoor activities, and people who are here don’t want you bragging about it to cool actual tech cities. You don’t like bugs or humidity or a million people living in your city.

You love to code, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was ok or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because ok or good isn’t fulfilling to you.

But… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3 depending on if you have religion in your life. Our goal is to use the incredible business we’ve been blessed to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life and then we think we’ll have more fun working together during the day, if we know there’s a clear cut off and can create a work environment where we can not only go home, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. There’s no hipster saving or changing the world bs mission statement here. We try to make it a non-hostile job that pays well and doesn’t stress you out so you can call it a day and go have fun personally.

Benefits:

About the Job:

The Cloud Engineering team is responsible for storing and processing, among other things, our massive amounts of location and driving updates. Our distributed, microservices-based environment handles billions of API calls daily, often with downstream effects which are surfaced to our users in real time, providing peace of mind and real-time emergency response to tens of millions of families.

We at Life360 have nearly doubled our user base each year for the last few years and we are focused on continuing to feed this growth for the foreseeable future. As we grow, we continue to meet the difficult challenges of increased data management and API traffic. Among the projects we are taking on in the near-to-mid future are building an event stream to upgrade our first-in-class location storage engine, splitting apart our PHP monolith into JVM-based microservices, and updating our persistence layer to meet the growing demands of storage.

Responsibilities:

The goal of the Cloud Services team is to identify potential bottlenecks which will prevent us from scaling 10x and develop solutions to these bottlenecks. A successful candidate will contribute code directly to this effort, working with the other Cloud engineers on their team to design and write implementations of stories. They will help push the story through the various stages of development, testing, release, and ongoing maintenance.

We are looking for someone who has some experience with shipping code to production and is excited about learning how to maintain a system which handles billions of daily API calls.

These are some typical responsibilities:
Work with engineering and project managers to define story requirements
Use JIRA to define and track status of stories
Development of story tasks, collaborating with other cloud team members
Development of a test plan and execution of appropriate tests, including unit and automation tests
Ensure appropriate metrics, monitoring, and logging are in place
Work with devops engineers to ship features to development and production using Kubernetes
Build dashboards and alerts for ongoing monitoring of features and services
Minimum Qualifications:

We are looking for candidates with a diverse background that will complement the skills and backgrounds of the current team.

Familiar with database operations and usage (we use primarily MySQL, Cassandra, and DynamoDB)
If you have any of these, consider it a bonus
Experience in another programming language a plus (our systems mainly use Python, Java, and PHP)

We are bringing together everyone involved in the closing process onto one shared, secure platform -- basically, we're making buying a home in America easier, safer, cheaper, and less painful by moving the process online! Qualia was founded in 2015 by Forbes 30 Under 30 Award recipients Nate Baker, Joel Gottsegen and Lucas Hansen. The company is backed by top investors including 8VC, Bienville Capital, Menlo Ventures and Tiger Global and currently processes 20% of all US real estate transactions.

Our security team is responsible for ensuring the security of both our technology and our organization as a whole. The team is responsible for application threat modeling, active penetration testing, design and oversight of secure development practices, development of tooling for exploit prevention and intrusion detection, and educating the organization on security best practices.

We take security extremely seriously and do not drag our metaphorical feet on it. Yes, sometimes taking proper security measures can seem onerous or paranoid. But we've got our priorities straight.

As a security engineer you will work as a core member of the security team, with all of the responsibilities that entails. This role is an entry point into the security world, and while it doesn't require that you've previously worked in an official security position, it does require a deep passion for security that you've curated on your own time and a broad understanding of technology ranging from front-end all the way down to assembly. You will need to learn quickly and deeply.

Qualia hosts the official Meteor Developer's Night in our San Francisco HQ, which is the largest gathering of Meteor developers in the world. The event features talks on Meteor and Javascript development generally, often including talks from Qualia team members.
Qualia's Head of Design, Jack Lukic, is the creator of Semantic UI, one of the most popular open-source design frameworks. Qualia engineers learn this framework, and design patterns more generally, directly from the creator of the framework our front end is built on! Very few companies can say that.
As part of our focus on continual learning and development, a Qualia team member gives an educational talk on something they're interested in every Thursday to the entire engineering and product team. Topics range from Kolmogorov complexity theory to the definition of art, to models of existential risk.

Through its administration of the $10 billion Universal Service Fund (USF) programs on behalf of the FCC, USAC works to promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates and to increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the nation. Specifically, the USF programs provide funding for the expansion of telecommunications and broadband access to rural communities and health care facilities, schools and libraries across the country, and low income households. Through program administration, auditing, and outreach, USAC works with contributors, service providers, and program beneficiaries to achieve the program goals articulated by the FCC for each of these programs.
The FCC has reformed the USF to support further investment in and access to evolving broadband infrastructure, making the programs a primary vehicle to support this critical national priority. USAC, as the administrator of the USF, plays a critical role in supporting the ambitious vision to ensure that all citizens in the United States have access to high-speed broadband. The organization has approximately 500 employees with an operating budget of more than $200 million. USAC works in close partnership with the FCC and other federal and state partners to support the achievement of the USF program goals.
USAC administers the USF programs—High Cost, Lifeline, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries. USAC strives to provide efficient, responsible stewardship of the programs, a key national asset in making important telecommunications and Internet services available to consumers, health care providers, schools, and libraries throughout the United States. The program divisions are supported by additional USAC personnel in Finance, General Counsel, Information Systems, Internal Audit, the Enterprise Program Management Office and Human Resources. Consistent with FCC rules, USAC does not make policy for or interpret unclear provisions of statutes or the FCC’s rules.
Universal service is paid for by contributions from telecommunications carriers, including wireline and wireless companies, and interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol providers, including cable companies that provide voice service, based on an assessment of their interstate and international end- user revenues. These contributions are most typically passed through to consumers through a universal service fee line item on their telephone bills.

About Diversity and Inclusion


""Our company is committed to creating a culture that is not only grounded in continuous learning, teamwork, and customer success, but is fair, equitable, and welcoming for everyone."" Gregg Johnson CEO

And to us, diversity and inclusion means even more than treating current employees well and making them feel welcome. It also means proactively hiring people who bring different insights because of their unique demographics, ways of thinking, and prior experiences.

We intend to continue hiring great people and protecting our culture so everyone can be themselves and speak their minds. That way Invoca will always be a place filled with laughter, energy, hard work, thoughtfulness and respect.

819,Software Engineer,-1,"Over the coming years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy are dramatically changing how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials are transforming the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology are producing sustainable and ethical food. Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this reality, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.


Benchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.
Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.
Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.
Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure the right context is being shared.
Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.
YOU
Have 3-5 years of experience in software engineering.
Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.
Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.
Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.
Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).
YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:
Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.
A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.
Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.
A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.
OUR VALUES
Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.
Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.
Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""

About Us

Born out of frustration with the traditional cash register business, ShopKeep was designed by a retailer with a noble aim: to rescue independent business owners from the nightmare of archaic point of sale systems, and replace them with something beautiful, simple, and affordable. It turned out that by doing this, we were giving our merchants a fighting chance against the big guys.

Today, our mission is simple: empower independent business owners to dream big and to fight smart. We're doing this through our cloud-based architecture and intuitive software that delivers the data small business owners need to run smarter businesses.

As we adapt to recent changes in the way our merchants are having to conduct business, we are looking for talented and experienced Senior Engineers who can help us align around initiatives and build out the changes needed to ensure we continue to support our merchants in these challenging times.

Our Stack

At Shopkeep we use a wide variety of technologies. While we have core technologies that we work with, we're always trying to pick the best tool for the job, and are always looking at what's on the horizon.

Our stack currently includes:
React, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Python, React Native, Go
Jenkins, Circle CI, Kubernetes, Docker and AWS
We use Git for source control, write tests and run continuous integration, and review each other's code through pull requests.
Ideally, you will have 5+ years experience in at least one of these technologies or similar patterns; notably, Javascript coupled with React is a core technology for us. But we are more interested in your broader experience of software development, across these languages, rather than of specific tools or libraries.

You should be comfortable getting up-to-speed quickly in new tools and platforms. You should be pragmatic and experienced enough to know when a different choice of technology would be more suitable, and comfortable leading explorations into new technologies.

Strategically, as we move towards a microservice architecture, in this role we would expect you to significantly contribute in pursuit of this goal.

How we work

We expect our Senior Software Engineers to be passionate about working in teams, building features to improve the experience of our existing customers, in a collaborative way.

You'll be working in a cross functional, autonomous team, where you will regularly collaborate with our DevOps and Security teams when required.

We practice Scrum and work lean.

Work is not siloed, you're able to commit across the stack, and you have a view of all the features the teams are working on.

We use data to drive continuous improvement in our development process and we review this data in our fortnightly retrospectives.

If you have strong development experience on a product focused team, real passion for new technologies, open source, small businesses, and a desire to grow and learn, then we might be the right team for you.

Your role
Write clean, readable code - it's not easy but it's important.
Work with your team and our Test Engineers to ensure excellent test coverage
Participate in our peer code review process
Contribute to architecture decisions and pairing sessions
Collaborate with your team in the development and delivery of new product features (all new ideas welcome).
Mentoring is a big part of our Senior's remit as we want to make sure we are setting people up for success within ShopKeep, so previous experience of managing or mentoring people is essential.
Complacency is not our friend, so we encourage all our engineers, especially Seniors, to work together to help us figure out what practices work and which ones don't. We also have initiatives like Chapter meetings and the Developer Experience Group to help with process improvement.
As we follow Agile principles we need our Senior Engineers to be responsible for a scrum team's agile health and agile fluency.

We are bringing together everyone involved in the closing process onto one shared, secure platform -- basically, we're making buying a home in America easier, safer, cheaper, and less painful by moving the process online!

Our security team is responsible for ensuring the security of both our technology and our organization as a whole. The team is responsible for application threat modeling, active penetration testing, design and oversight of secure development practices, development of tooling for exploit prevention and intrusion detection, and educating the organization on security best practices. More concisely, the security team is responsible for making sure the ""bad guys"" don't win.

We take security extremely seriously and do not drag our metaphorical feet on it. Yes, sometimes taking proper security measures can seem onerous or paranoid. But we've got our priorities straight.

As a senior security engineer, you will both directly work on object-level security challenges and also help create meta-level security principles to guide the organization as a whole. You are expected to have ""been around the block"" but to also keep up-to-date on novel developments in the security industry. You will be a mentor to engineers across the entire team.

Senior security engineers need to have broad and deep technical knowledge. Security cannot be reduced down to a static bag of tricks. It requires sophisticated knowledge of how all software works and mature mental models of how to reason about the security of complex systems. Senior security engineers already possess the knowledge and mental models necessary to be successful in their role and are constantly working to improve them.

Perform active penetration testing and threat modeling
Educate the engineering team on security best practices
Build tools for automatic exploit detection and intrusion detection

Qualia engineers learn this framework, and design patterns more generally, directly from the creator of the framework our front end is built on! Very few companies can say that.

Externally, we want to amaze people with how much we care about both the products we build and the services we provide that happens by noticing and acting on opportunities to value others.

High Performance

What we are trying to accomplish is hard. While thoughtfulness is central to how we engage others, a personal ethic of high performance is needed across the company for us to succeed. High performance is a major focus in every role across the company.

Just as we want to serve our customers, we want to serve you, our teammates (we call ourselves AlgaeBuds), and make sure that you enjoy your work every single day.

But don’t be confused. Being the real deal also means our standards are sky high and we don’t let just anyone into our family. When we say you’ll enjoy every single day you work here, there will surely be some challenging moments. (Let’s be real here, no job is perfect!)

But we promise you that every day you’ll have a moment... a moment of clarity or empowerment or a surge of adrenaline that will tell you that you’re doing what you love and are making a difference in this crazy, beautiful world.

What Will You Earn?
